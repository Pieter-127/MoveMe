# Summary
Very simple single transition of an image with motion layout, nothing too fancy, this was just a playground for learning some basics with android motion layout

# How it's done
The project makes use of MotionLayout to achieve a transition by making use of different constraint sets, really very simple and nothing too complicated

# How would you run this ? 
You can simply clone this from github and open the project using android studio (the `master` branch is usually where the latest stable build can be found, `dev` is where I work on new features)  there shouldn't be any additional requirements or configurations needed.
